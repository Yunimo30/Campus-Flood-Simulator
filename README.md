Campus Flood Simulation — Prototype (Production Phase)

1. Overview
This project is a prototype of a digital twin flood prediction tool designed for school campuses. It enables administrators and disaster response teams to simulate rainfall scenarios and assess flood risks on surrounding streets.

The system integrates interactive maps (Leaflet.js) and visual analytics (Chart.js) to visualize flood levels, hazard zones, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

2. Objectives
Provide a visual decision-support tool for schools in flood-prone areas.
Demonstrate how historical sensitivity values (per street) can be used to estimate flood severity.
Serve as a presentation-ready prototype for stakeholders while remaining extensible for future production.
3. Features
Interactive Map: Leaflet-based map centered on selected campuses with hazard radius overlays.
Campus Selection: Users can select campuses (DLSU, UST, Mapúa, UPD, etc.) to simulate localized flooding.
Rainfall Simulation:
Adjustable rainfall intensity (mm/hr).
Adjustable duration (minutes).
Predefined quick-scenario buttons (Light, Moderate, Heavy).
Flood Risk Table: Tabular breakdown of expected flood levels per street with severity color coding.
Rainfall Profile Chart: Displays rainfall intensity over time slices.
Hazard Breakdown Chart: Pie chart summarizing safe, moderate, high, and severe categories.
KPIs:
Estimated flood onset time (minutes).
Number of passable routes (streets remaining safe).
Placeholder model accuracy (for demonstration).
4. System Architecture
Frontend-Only Web Application (no backend at prototype stage).
Core Components:
index.html → layout and structure.
style.css → visual design and theming.
data.js → static dataset of campuses and street sensitivities.
script.js → business logic, simulation engine, chart/map updates.
Libraries Used:
Leaflet.js for interactive mapping.
Chart.js for visualization.
5. Data Handling
Input Data:
Rainfall intensity and duration provided by the user.
Historical flood sensitivity values per street (hardcoded).
Simulation Formula:
totalRainfall = intensity × (duration / 60)
expectedFloodHeight (cm) = totalRainfall × sensitivity × scaleFactor
